Dr Kristy Pamela Robledo (PhD, M. Biostat) is an early career biostatistician at the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre (CTC) University of Sydney. She has over 10 years’ experience in clinical trials research gained from her research-based job at University of Sydney (2008-present). Responsible for the provision of statistical leadership to clinical trial networks in oncology, neonatology, diabetes, cardiovascular and other areas to design, undertake, analyse and report on clinical trials. She has a specific interest in the use of biomarkers in clinical trials research. This includes the statistical methodology within clinical trials, and the use of biomarkers to model longer term outcomes. She is responsible for content development, coordination, and teaching of external short courses in statistics as well as units of study for the [Masters of Clinical Trials Research](https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pc/master-of-clinical-trials-research.html). She is also a lecturer and developed materials for the annual statistical training provided to Australia and New Zealand Radiation Oncology trainees.
