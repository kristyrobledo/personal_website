<h1>My first post!</h1>
<p>Ok so here goes. First blogdown post is happening right here!
H/T and thankyou to <a href="https://twitter.com/rlbarter">Rebecca Barter</a> on twitter. Her simple tweet got me to bite the bullet and actually start…. No more talking about Future Kristy.</p>
<p>So, I thought the best first blog is to detail this process. Maybe so I can do it again? Or maybe better yet to help someone else.</p>

<div id="what-is-blogdown" class="section level1">
<h1>What is Blogdown?</h1>
<p><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a> is an R package developed by people a lot smarter than me. It’s designed to be used within Rstudio (my safe place), so I feel like this can be done <strong>relatively easily</strong>.</p>

<h1>What to do??</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to github and create a new repo with a readme.md. I called my repo <a href="https://github.com/kristyrobledo/personal_website">personal_website</a>.</li>
<li>Go into Rstudio <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a> and create a <code>new project</code>&gt;<code>version control</code>&gt;<code>git</code> and enter in the address to your new repo. This will automatically setup from the empty repo.</li>
<li>Install <code>blogdown</code> with</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(blogdown)</code></pre>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Checkout the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a> and suss out what you like. I copied Rebecca and went with <code>hugo-future-imperfect</code>. So original.</p></li>
<li><p>Back into Rstudio and lets create the site, based on the theme example to make life easier!</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>new_site(theme=&quot;jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://jpescador.com/blog/future-imperfect-theme-release-on-the-go-hugo-static-website-engine/">Julio’s website</a> for more specifics on the theme.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I immediately used</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>build_site()</code></pre>
<p>to render the site and check it out. Fun - works!!</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Configured <code>config.toml</code> to my liking. Then <code>build_site()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Next I went into <code>Content&gt;about&gt;Index.md</code> and changed this to reflect my CV. <code>build_site()</code> to check it out.</p></li>
<li><p>After this I decided it was time to push up to github - all using the git pane within Rstudio.</p></li>
<li><p>Now with the shell of a website I decided it was time to try deployment….. rather than spending a lot more time on this and then failing at deployment!</p></li>
<li><p>Head to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" class="uri">https://www.netlify.com/</a> and create a free account. I created mine through github.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <code>new site</code> and create a new site from the correct github repo. Once you have deployed it, you can also change your domain - luckily there are very few Kristy Robledo’s around and I snagged <a href="https://kristyrobledo.netlify.com//" class="uri">https://kristyrobledo.netlify.com//</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Looks like it deployed! Wow - seriously as easy as people really did write and I actually still have no idea what css is or how to code it.</p></li>
<li><p>To create a post…. use the “Addin” bar in Rstudio and click <code>New Post</code>. Complete the metadata (feeds directly into your yaml) and like magic…. it just works!</p></li>
